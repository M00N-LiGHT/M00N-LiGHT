### Introduction
Hi hello, i go with the name light. All I do is code in random games which I don't really care about, and just have fun. 
I mainly code in:
* Lua
* Python

Those are the only 2 languages I code in, since I know them best. Any projects I make out of pure boredom will be posted here, big projects will most probably be in a whole folder, or behind a paywall, due to stuff I don't even know about. Thank's for reading, have a good day lmao
